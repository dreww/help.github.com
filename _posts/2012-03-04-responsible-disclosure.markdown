We want to keep GitHub safe for everyone. If you've discovered a security vulnerability in GitHub, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

## White Hat

Publicly disclosing a vulnerability can put the entire community at risk. If you've discovered a security concern, **please email us at [security@github.com](mailto:security@github.com)**. We'll work with you to make sure that we understand the scope of the issue, and that we fully address your concern. We consider correspondence sent to **[security@github.com](mailto:security@github.com)** our highest priority, and work to address any issues that arise as quickly as possible.

Please act in good faith towards our users' privacy and data during your disclosure. We won't take legal action against you or administrative action against your account if you act accordingly: White hat researchers are always appreciated.
